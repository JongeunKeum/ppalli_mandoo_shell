jkeum&amp;hyunlee's 42seoul minishell team project repo #42seoul #shell

The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell.<br>
Yes, your little bash or zsh.<br>
You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.<br>
At the time, all coders agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating.<br>
It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to english.<br>
With Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didn’t exist.
